 abstract = {Abstract Many in the mathematical community believe that the secant method arose from Newton’s method using a finite difference approximation to the derivative, most likely because that is the way that it is taught in contemporary texts. However, we were able to trace the origin of the secant method all the way back to the Rule of Double False Position described in the 18th-century b.c. Egyptian Rhind Papyrus, by showing that the Rule of Double False Position coincides with the secant method applied to a linear equation. As such, it predates Newton’s method by more than 3,000 years. In this paper, we recount the evolution of the Rule of Double False Position as it spanned many civilizations over the centuries leading to what we view today as the contemporary secant method. Unfortunately, throughout history naming confusion has surrounded the Rule of Double False Position. This naming confusion was primarily a product of the last 500 years or so and became particularly troublesome in the past 50 years, creating confusion in the use of the terms Double False Position method, Regula Falsi method, and secant method. We elaborate on this confusion and clarify the names used.},

abstract = {For solving nonlinear, univariate and unconstrained optimization problems, Newton method is an important and basic method which convergences quadratically. In this paper, we suggest a family of three new modifications of the classical Secant method where the iteration formula including an approximation of f″(xk) is satisfied by a recursive scheme. The efficiencies of the new methods are analyzed in terms of the most popular and widely used criterion; the number of iterations, in comparison with the Newton and Secant methods using six test functions.}
