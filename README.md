Read STC.pdf for details.

## Build C++
```make```
or
``` g++ ... ```

## Build LaTeX


## Temp (Ideas)
function to read in data
vector class to handle the data? Or should i just use std::vector

## To Do
* Rewrite read_file to do chunk size reading of data
* make sure using 4 spaces NOT tab (ctrl shift p convert indentation to spaces)
* give circle a constructors!

## Notes (temp)
Use paralisation?
Remember to load chhunks of 1000 events or something
-> Maybe not actually a problem
-> But for root file output definitely do this.

SHOULD I BE USING MEAN SQUARED ERROR?
